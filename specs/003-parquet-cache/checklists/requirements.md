## Notes

- Specification derived from approved proposal at `docs/browser-data-persistence-proposal.md`
- All key decisions (TTL, invalidation strategy, UI requirements) were pre-clarified with stakeholder
- No implementation technologies mentioned (IndexedDB mentioned in proposal but not in spec)
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
